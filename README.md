# R2 File Manager

R2 File Manager is a simple and lightweight file management system, designed to be used in serverless environments. I created it as I needed a simple way to manage my R2 bucket files, and I couldn't find any existing projects that met my requirements. The example tutorials using curl/put/S3 API didn't work or didn't suit my use-case. I also implemented a file listing method as I couldn't find a working way to do it with any function calls. Maybe there are ways to do this, but I didn't want to waste my time finding itðŸ˜’.

## Functionality

The system includes the following features:

- **File Upload**: Users can upload files to the server. This is done via a `PUT` request to the server. The file data is stored in the R2 bucket under the given key.
- **File Listing**: Users can view a list of uploaded files. This is achieved by maintaining a `file-list.txt` in the bucket that contains the names of all uploaded files. The list is updated whenever a file is uploaded or deleted.
- **File Download**: Users can download any uploaded file. This is done via a `GET` request with the file's key. The file data is fetched from the R2 bucket.
- **File Deletion**: Users can delete any uploaded file. This is done via a `GET` request to the `/delete/{filename}` path. The file is removed from the R2 bucket and the file name is removed from `file-list.txt`.

## Usage

The system is designed to be run in a serverless environment, with the main functionality being handled by the Cloudflare Worker.

The worker handles the following HTTP methods:

- `GET`: Fetches the file list or a specific file, or handles file deletion.
- `PUT`: Uploads a file to the server.
- `POST`: Receives file data from a form and saves the file.

## Deployment

Install the required packages and follow the [Cloudflare tutorials](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/tutorials/configure-your-cdn/).

1. `npm create cloudflare@latest`
2. `cd` to the new application directory
3. `wrangler r2 bucket create <YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>`
4. `mv wrangler.toml wrangler.toml.bak && echo -e "name = 'YOUR_APPLICATION_NAME'\nmain = 'src/worker.ts'\ncompatibility_date = 'yyyy-mm-dd'\n\n[[r2_buckets]]\nbinding = 'MY_BUCKET'\nbucket_name = '<YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>'" > wrangler.toml`
5. `mv src/worker.ts worker.ts.bak && > worker.ts`
6. `vi src/worker.ts` and paste the `worker.js`
7. `npx wrangler deploy`

## Caution

Please keep an eye on your R2 charges ([Cloudflare R2 Pricing](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/)). The functions implemented in this system will generate a number of Class A & B requests. If you want to keep your usage within the free tier, make sure to monitor your usage.

## Security

There is no authentication implemented in this system, as I'm using Cloudflare Access as the access control method. You should add your custom domain and/or the worker domain `<worker>.<name>.workers.dev` to be protected by Access (Self-hosted).
